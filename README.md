French tutorial on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ibpH2RUd7E&t=1s

First of all, you have to install Python3 AND 'pip'. Then run the `setup.bat` file.
It will install you the necessary libraries for the program.  
  
Pandore contains two parts:
  - Client
  - Server (hosted by me, don't touch it unless you are a developper)
  
**1: Client**
<p align="center">

</p>

The client part is the `main.py` file, that you will use to host your Discord Bot.

In order for it to work, the server has to be on. But, since I host the server, don't worry about that.

Firstly, join my <a href="discord.gg/plague">Discord</a> server, and send `>gen` in the commands section.

The Pandore Bot will send you a new key, which will allow you to host your Discord Bot!

Then, once you got your key, execute the file, enter the key, and select your mode.

You can upload/delete your Discord Bot from the server at any moment, and it will be hosted 24/7 for free!


For the tutorial, let's try with the `example.py` file. Of course, replace the token in the code with your Bot's token.

The Bot is now on! Let's test it!

Sweet! You now know how to publish your own Discord Bot!
